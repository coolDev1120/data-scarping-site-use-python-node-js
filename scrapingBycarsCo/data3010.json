This dynamic vehicle is very popular amongst the youth as it is fun-to-drive. \nThe interior trim is so neat boasting with a cream and slight black color finish, electronic windows, power steering and beautiful dashboard finishes. \nSmall styling tweaks differentiate the DS3 Cabrio from its hard-top sibling. There is a new spoiler along the width of the rear, aerodynamic deflectors on the quarter-light surrounds and a beguiling new three-dimensional LED rear light signature that was inspired by Citroën. The snazzy lamps complement the DS’s prestige feel. At the push of a button on the ceiling console of the DS3 Cabrio’s well-laid-out cabin, the folding soft-top can be set to one of three positions – intermediate, horizontal and total. The roof can be operated at speeds of up to 75mph and takes 16sec to close from the fully open position. When the roof is fully closed, noise insulation is very good. When the canvas top has been retracted, wind levels are acceptable at the sort of speeds you'll do around town. The well-proven 1.6- engine is a delight. With just a touch of turbo, it packs plenty of energy up when changing gears. To end off the DS3 Cabrio rides comfortably, even on the 17in wheel rims fitted. The Citroën has an unconventional boot opening that moves outwards and upwards, remaining flush with the rear of the car. With full Dekra condition and roadworthy report.
