The 5 Series has long been the benchmark by which other sport sedans are measured. This elevated position presents challenges when such a stellar car is due for an update.\n\nBMW accomplished its mission with a redesign in 1997 that gave it a look and feel that remained popular right up until the latest redesign last year. Although the 2004 BMW 5 Series was considered a complete redesign, the changes to the car's basic character seemed more like subtle refinements. It was already a comfortable, capable and highly dynamic machine. The latest version is still all of these things, just a bit more so.\n\nIn terms of overall philosophy, the largest shift from the previous model came in the form of technology. Several items were pulled directly from the current-generation 7 Series, including iDrive, Active Roll Stabilization (ARS), Active Cruise Control (ACC) and a Harman Kardon Logic7 sound system. While much of the 7's technology has migrated down to the 5, several advanced technologies made their debut on BMW's midsize sport sedan. The most exciting of these is dubbed Active Front Steering (AFS), a system that is able to adjust both the steering ratio and the amount of power assist for optimum feel and control under varying driving conditions. Along with all the technology came an aggressive new body that most people either love or hate. For 2006, BMW has fitted the 525 and 530 models with an all-new 3.0-liter inline six, and replaced the 4.4-liter V8 with a 4.8-liter unit. For 2006, BMW has fitted the 525 and 530 models with an all-new 3.0-liter inline six. The versatile wagon body style is also back in the lineup this year, as is an all-wheel-drive system dubbed xDrive. The system is electronically controlled and uses a multiplate clutch for infinite variation in the front/rear power ratio. It works with BMW's Dynamic Stability Control (DSC), using data taken from the yaw rate and steering angle sensors to adjust the distribution of power. Further, when DSC takes corrective braking action on a single wheel, xDrive automatically redirects torque to the wheel opposite it. This means the car can keep moving even if only one wheel has traction.\n\nWith excellent power and sharp handling, the 2006 BMW 5 Series further builds on its reputation as a luxury sedan of unequaled athleticism. An endless array of technology and polarizing sheet metal may distinguish the current generation in the minds of consumers, but in the end, it's the 5's continued status as a true driver's car that will make the sale.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":1508190577,"count":8,"path":"carsimages","name":"8339931","extension":".jpg"},"make":"BMW","mileage":"245 000 Km","model":"5 Series","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":69995,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2006 BMW 5 Series 525i Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"525i Auto","variant_short":"525i","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2006-BMW-5-Series-525i-Auto-Western-Cape-Cape-Town/8339931/","year":2006},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3172"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8339931"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8339930","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.1975987,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.02111215,"agent_locality":"Johannesburg","agent_name":"Auto Champion Motors 2","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"SUV","body_type_code":"SUV","colour":"SILVER","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Good","description":"The noted price is for a cash purchase however we do offer finance through all banks including IEMAS and Investec.
