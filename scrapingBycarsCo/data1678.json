But this is a new kind of Fiat for today's buyer. The company has partnered with Chrysler and is making a concerted effort to woo consumers with its uniquely Italian style, admirable fuel economy and competitive content. Doing this for family-oriented buyers is the 2015 Fiat 500L.\n\nIntroduced in 2015 the Fiat 500L may share its name with the plucky two-door hatchback and cabriolet we've grown accustomed to seeing, but that's where the similarities end. With two more doors, more than 2 feet of added length and as much interior volume as some small crossovers, the 2015 500L is a wholly different car from the standard Fiat 500. High-mounted front seats give the driver and front passenger a commanding view of the road, and rear head- and legroom and cargo capacity are plentiful. Have a carload of kids but need a stop at the grocery store on the way home? \n\nOn paper, the 500L seems like a great combination of the personality of the pocket-sized 500 hatchback with the roominess of a small crossover. The 500L's 160-horsepower, turbocharged four-cylinder engine provides enough power for trips around town. The new six-speed automatic is definitely more refined and helps make better use of the 500L's limited power.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":3553297306,"count":8,"path":"carsimages","name":"8271605","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Fiat","mileage":"114 000 Km","model":"500L","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":159995,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2015 Fiat 500L 1.4 TJet Trekking","transmission":"Manual","variant":"1.4 TJet Trekking","variant_short":"1.4","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2015-Fiat-500L-1.4-TJet-Trekking-Western-Cape-Cape-Town/8271605/","year":2015},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3172"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8271605"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8271602","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.11419382,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.23076154,"agent_locality":"Kempton Park","agent_name":"Treasure City Cars","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Hatchback","body_type_code":"H/B","colour":"WHITE","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"We deal with all kind of used cars, Cash or Bank Finance, We provide excellent customer service and quality pre-owned vehicles.
