The K2700 feels the same way. The first thought from the KIA engineers when designing the K2700 was to make sure that it never lets you down. The K2700 has the perfect workhorse engine – a 2.7 litre, 4 cylinder, J2 diesel power plant that delivers 62kW of power at and 165 Nm of torque at 2400 rpm. The K2700 has a 2 810 mm long deck and 1 630 mm wide bed, giving you abundant loading capacity. The railed truck bed has a low height of only 733 mm for easier access when loading and unloading. The easily operated catcher has a better grip thanks to its ergonomic handle and an inner spring to ensure smooth movement. For the organisation of small miscellaneous items, the front centre seatback folds down to reveal a multifunctional console for practical storage, in addition to a storage space within the centre console. Electric windows and an independent sliding & reclining driver’s seat ensure comfort and easy accessibility. The K2700 comes with a 5-year unlimited mileage mechanical warranty, 3 year 60 000km service plan, 5-year roadside assistance. \n\nAll prices exclude administration, delivery and license registration fees.
