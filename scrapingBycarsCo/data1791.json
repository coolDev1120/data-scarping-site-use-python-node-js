The GT Sport Cambiocorsa uses the same 460bhp 4.7-litre V8 as the MC Stradale. The semi-manual car feels better behaved in corners, with a more neutral handling balance to keep the keen driver entertained. \nCompared to the smooth-shifting traditional auto, the Cambiocorsa is more aggressive in its gearchanges when on the attack and less refined when pottering about in town. Sporty drivers will, of course, care more about the speed of the gearshifts – 100 milliseconds in the case of the Cambiocorsa, half the time taken by the ZF system.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":1496624978,"count":9,"path":"carsimages","name":"8262994","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Maserati","mileage":"97 619 Km","model":"GranTurismo","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Air Conditioning, Power Steering, Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD), Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Cruise Control, Radio / CD, Security System, Air Bag, Central Locking","price":569990,"province":"Kwazulu Natal","reference":"10BMUSDR047303","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2009 Maserati GranTurismo S","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"S","variant_short":"S","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2009-Maserati-GranTurismo-S-Kwazulu-Natal-Ballito/8262994/","year":2009},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"6570"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8262994"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8262995","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.683184,"agent_coords_1_coord":27.834313,"agent_featured":"2","agent_locality":"Vanderbijlpark","agent_name":"Koos & Mike Used Cars","body_type":"Hatchback","body_type_code":"H/B","colour":"Blue","commercial_type":"a","description":"","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 3 870.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 21 990.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":2618793405,"count":20,"path":"carsimages","name":"8262995","extension":".jpg"},"make":"BMW","mileage":"113 000 Km","model":"1 Series","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Although the Dealer has not listed any extras, you can contact the Dealer on the listed number, or fill out the form for further information on this vehicle.","price":219900,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"1955-01009_22","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2013 BMW 1 Series 118i 5-dr M Sport","transmission":"Manual","variant":"118i 5-dr M Sport","variant_short":"118i","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2013-BMW-1-Series-118i-5-dr-M-Sport-Gauteng-Vanderbijlpark/8262995/","year":2013},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3328"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8262995"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8262997","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.683184,"agent_coords_1_coord":27.834313,"agent_featured":"2","agent_locality":"Vanderbijlpark","agent_name":"Koos & Mike Used Cars","body_type":"Sedan","body_type_code":"S/D","colour":"Grey","commercial_type":"a","description":"OPTIONAL 12 MONTH WARRANTY AVAILABLE \n\nTHIS VEHICLE IS IN GREAT CONDITION.
