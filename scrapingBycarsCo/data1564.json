Well, thanks to a spate of entrants into the South African market in 2016, choice is no longer an issue. In the larger MPV category, the Nissan NV200 and VW Cross Caddy are relative newcomers, while the Suzuki Ertiga (tested in the November 2014 issue) and now the Honda Mobilio are smaller and more affordable seven-seater offerings.\n\nSourced from India, the Mobilio is a totally different package to one of our favourite-ever Hondas, the defunct FR-V. Instead of two rows of three seats like that vehicle, the Mobilio uses the more conventional two-plus-three-plus-two layout. The second row is split 60:40 and it can fold and tumble to allow easy access to the seats behind. This row also slides to adjust the legroom ratio to the rearmost bench. The last row splits 50:50 and the backrests fold and cushions tumble to provide luggage space in lieu of the sixth and seventh occupants.\n\nBlack cloth upholstery provides sufficient comfort and won’t show staining easily, and there’s impressive legroom all-round and reasonable.\n\nThe suspension is set up to cope with poor-quality roads – an aspect of daily commuting shared between South Africa and India – and therefore the ride is absorbent. The downside, of course, is body sway when making sudden lane changes.\n\nSafety features include two airbags and ABS plus EBD.\n\nThis car is in excellent
