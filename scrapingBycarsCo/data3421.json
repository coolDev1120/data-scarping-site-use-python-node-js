A delicate balance needs to be achieved in order to get your wife to agree to letting you buy it. This car is the perfect tool for the job. At a glance, its a practical 4 door sedan capable of lugging the kids to and from school with plenty of boot space. Upon closer inspection, lets hope your wife doesn't notice the cracking 6.0 V8 powerplant, or the exaggerated wide arches..\n\nall joking aside, its difficult to find a lumina SS with proper ownership. I've done the hard work for you and managed to find a one owner since new, full service history example. original wheels and the stock exhaust. I cant stress the importance of a car like this having owner since new... as all affordable, older performance cars tend to have passed through multiple owners. This often leads to incomplete service histories, varying driving styles etc.\n\nyou have to come and have a look at this car to appreciate the kind of ownership it has had. This example has covered 114000kms since new. Clean, unmolestered examples are fetching close to R500 000. here, I offer you exactly that for R329 000. \n","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":2077726533,"count":20,"path":"carsimages","name":"7936833","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Chevrolet","mileage":"114 000 Km","model":"Lumina","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":299000,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2010 Chevrolet Lumina 6.0 SS Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"6.0 SS Auto","variant_short":"SS","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2010-Chevrolet-Lumina-6.0-SS-Auto-Gauteng-Randburg/7936833/","year":2010},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"381"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/7936833"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"7936817","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.0437967,"agent_coords_1_coord":27.955407,"agent_locality":"North Riding","agent_name":"RightCars JHB","body_type":"SUV","body_type_code":"SUV","colour":"Black","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Good","description":"","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":2178926562,"count":5,"path":"carsimages","name":"7936817","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Mercedes-Benz","mileage":"262 000 Km","model":"ML","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":97900,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"30724","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2006 Mercedes-Benz ML 500 Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"500 Auto","variant_short":"500","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2006-Mercedes-Benz-ML-500-Auto-Gauteng-North-Riding/7936817/","year":2006},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"2339"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/7936817"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"7936794","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-29.7895103,"agent_coords_1_coord":30.7746489,"agent_locality":"Hillcrest","agent_name":"SMG Toyota Hillcrest","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Sedan","body_type_code":"S/D","colour":"Silver","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"PROUD MEMBER OF THE SMG GROUP\nCERTIFIED 20 POINT CHECK \nAPPROVED AND TESTED","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 5 980.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 34 000.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":3723863223,"count":7,"path":"carsimages","name":"7936794","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Lexus","mileage":"105 500 Km","model":"ES","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Alarm, Radio, Leather seats, Aircon, ABS, Climate control","price":339990,"province":"Kwazulu Natal","reference":"4542","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2018 Lexus ES 250","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"250","variant_short":"250","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2018-Lexus-ES-250-Kwazulu-Natal-Hillcrest/7936794/","year":2018},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"1772"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/7936794"}}]
