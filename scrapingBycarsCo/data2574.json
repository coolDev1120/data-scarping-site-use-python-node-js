COUPE AUTO, ONE METICULOUS LADY OWNER SINCE NEW, FULL SERVICE HISTORY FROM MERCEDES BENZ SINCE NEW, 164 800 KM’S SELLING FOR ONLY R 229 950.00, PRISTINE CONDITION. \nFor most of you out there, this just looks like a normal clean C180 Coupe, to me this is the holy grail of used cars. You simply cannot compare the condition of a genuine one owner from new full agent history to most of the cars out there, these cars are hard to find and do not come around to often. If you are looking for one of the best kept C180 Coupes currently available in SA, here she is. \nWe evaluate so many cars on a daily basis and most of them don’t make the cut but when I see the owner jump out of the prettiest little coupe I’ve ever seen with a file that contains every single service and repair invoice since the vehicle was new, you have my attention because I know I’m about to buy a special car. \nWHY THIS CAR IS SPECIAL? \n•\tOne genuine lady owner from new\n•\tFull service history from Mercedes Benz \n•\tPanoramic glass sliding roof \n•\tThe most amazing red colour\n•\tNever seen any previous paint work\n•\tSpare key is still brand new\n•\tAll four tyres are in new condition \n•\tInterior is like new \n•\tBluetooth\n\nThese amazing vehicles are light on petrol, safe, well built, and will last you for ever. Proper value for money in my opinion, there might be other ones out there with less mileage, but they are not even close condition wise and more than likely do not have a full agent service history. This car has ticked all of my boxes and I would highly recommend it to anyone. \nWHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR WHEN WE BOUGHT IT? \n•\tThere is a small scrape on the bottom left bumper corner, you can see it if you zoom in on the pics, we have had to respray the front bumper. \n•\tPush out dent on the driver’s door, we have sorted that out\n•\t4 stage clay bar and paint protection polish\n•\tValet \nThis vehicle looks like it has 40 000 Km’s on the clock, I don’t think this will be here for too long, so if you are on the market and would like to buy a special car, you know what to do (call us). \nAfter reading this advert and re-living driving it and taking the pics I think we have priced it to low and we should put the price up!\n","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R
