In my opinion, the Chinese manufacturers are now where the Koreans were 10 years ago when they launched the new generation KIA SPORTAGE and HYUNDAI IX35.

The Koreans are still making a good product but the price is no longer so affordable with their entrylevel S.U.Vs selling for over R400 000. Enter the BAIC X25. It is just such a cool S.U.V. ALL THE MODERN FEATURES AND LUXURIES INCLUDING TOUCH SCREEN INFOTAINMENT WITH FULLY INTEGRATED SMARTPHONE CONNECTIVITY. Just such a beautiful looking S.U.V.
