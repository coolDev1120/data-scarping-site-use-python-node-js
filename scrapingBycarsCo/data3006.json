These 3.0 V6 motors were the last of the true ALFA ROMEO built engines before they reverted to the generic and heartbreakingly disappointing GM general motors engines found in the 159 and BRERAs. This 3.0 V6 sings in the old raspy Barry White tone that made the brand so revered and adored. I have yearned for this sound for years and couldnt believe my luck when I stumbled upon this vehicle. It soothes me every time I have the pleasure of driving it. It is instantaneously clear that great care and love has been taken in looking after and maintaining her.
