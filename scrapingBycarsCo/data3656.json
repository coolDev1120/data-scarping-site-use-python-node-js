Here is an example of the finest Bentleys, the 30’s cars. Hand built, bespoke, built to last forever, this is a 1936 Derby Bentley with bodywork by Hooper. It presents itself well and is on the button. Its an original example and would be a worthy addition to any collection. Combine this with the fact that it is a moveable asset of international worth and the car needs strong consideration. delivered to Archibald Blair in April of 1937, the vehicle found its way to the colonies some time after the war, beginning in Rhodesia, it has spent most of its subsequent life in the Transvaal, being TG 1985 for many years, then SJK123T. The Hooper body is particularly attractive, being not as austere as some of the other bodybuilders and constructed almost entirely out of aluminum. There simply are so few of these magnificent cars left here\n\nfor additional information and pictures, please visit our website using the link below\n\nwww.executivecars.co.za","image":{"version":2240250149,"count":27,"path":"carsimages","name":"7143030","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Bentley","mileage":"99 999 Km","model":"4.5","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":1299000,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"","seller_type":"agent","title":"1936 Bentley 4.5 4.25 by Hooper","variant":"4.25 by Hooper","variant_short":"","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/1936-Bentley-4.5-4.25-by-Hooper-Gauteng-Randburg/7143030/","year":1936},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"381"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/7143030"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"7141728","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.09760701,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.01008122,"agent_locality":"Randburg","agent_name":"Executive Cars","agent_vin_required":"0","colour":"Midnight Blue","condition":"Good","description":"This is a very early example [1967] of the exceedingly rare Bentley T1.

An elegant addition to anyones collection . This is a real opportunity for someone to grab a relative bargain and finish the restoration themselves.
