With the redesign came a switch to a car-based architecture and an emphasis on features and value. It was a welcome change, and for 2008, the Kia Sportage stays the course. As with its corporate twin, the Hyundai Tucson, the Sportage boasts a handsome cabin with quality materials, great ergonomics and a smartly designed split-folding rear seat.\n\nThe Sportage features a functional, roomy and attractive interior. Both the materials and build quality are very good, especially for this price point. The rear-seat design makes hauling a large amount of cargo a breeze -- it folds and lowers into the footwell, making for a flat load floor, and removing the head restraints isn't required.\n\nThis vehicle has a FULL SERVICE HISTORY included.\n\nFeel free to contact us today.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":1286346139,"count":8,"path":"carsimages","name":"8285908","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Kia","mileage":"185 000 Km","model":"Sportage","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":119995,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2008 Kia Sportage 2.0 CRDi 4x4","transmission":"Manual","variant":"2.0 CRDi 4x4","variant_short":"2.0 CRDi","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2008-Kia-Sportage-2.0-CRDi-4x4-Western-Cape-Cape-Town/8285908/","year":2008},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3172"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8285908"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8285905","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-33.984113,"agent_coords_1_coord":18.466011,"agent_locality":"Claremont","agent_name":"Mekor Mazda Claremont","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Hatchback","body_type_code":"H/B","colour":"GOLD","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"Optional warranty available - Price excludes administration, delivery and license registration fees - Trade-ins accepted - Finance available at the dealership","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 2 110.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 11 990.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":3692234762,"count":12,"path":"carsimages","name":"8285905","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Toyota","mileage":"148 000 Km","model":"Etios","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":119900,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2015 Toyota Etios 1.5 XS 5-dr","transmission":"Manual","variant":"1.5 XS 5-dr","variant_short":"1.5","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2015-Toyota-Etios-1.5-XS-5-dr-Western-Cape-Claremont/8285905/","year":2015},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"4790"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8285905"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8285903","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-33.844587,"agent_coords_1_coord":18.54086973,"agent_featured":"2","agent_locality":"Cape Town","agent_name":"getWorth","body_type":"Coupe","body_type_code":"C/P","colour":"","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"We are so confident in the quality of this car, we offer a 7-day/700km return policy;
