This is my eyes is a proper luxury sedan, it’s a fantastic family vehicle. And that’s pretty much what you think of when you look at it, and you also expect it to drive like a big sedan all slow and sluggish top heavy around corners etc. well let me just tell you about the complete opposite, \nI must say from the start that this car really surprised me, it’s a proper wolf in sheep’s clothing. You just do not expect this car to be so powerful and such a good drive with the full-time all-wheel drive. The 8 speed gear box is very nice, quick smooth changes, when you engage it into sports mode and accelerate the 500 Nm and 180 Kw gets going quickly for such a big car. Please do not compare this to the 2.0 TDI version, there is no comparison and once you go for a test drive you will understand exactly what I mean and in saying all of the above about the performance you can also drive it every day in comfort or eco mode and get 7.2 litres per 100 Km’s and really enjoy her, \nWhen this 3.0 TDI S-Line was purchased new there were a lot of special order items on this particular model. \nWHY IS THIS CAR SPECIAL? \n•\tFactory S-Line Seats\n•\tFactory S-Line steering wheel\n•\tFull Service history\n•\tLots of extra’s\n•\tSatellite navigation \n•\tSun Roof \n•\tAll 4 Goodyear’s are in excellent condition \n•\tFront and rear PDC \n•\t7.2 l/100km Light on diesel \n•\tOriginal medical kit still intact \n•\tAudi rubber interior matts including boot\n•\tElectric memory seats \n•\t4x4 full-time (all-wheel drive permanent, locking centre differential, 40/60 torque split)\n•\tKey less go\nThis is one of the best luxury sedans I have driven in a long time, it’s got everything you need and more. Very underrated.
