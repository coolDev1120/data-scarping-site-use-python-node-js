Apart from being much more handsomely styled than its predecessor, the new BT-50 offers appreciably more appeal for buyers who want the practicality and looks of a bakkie, but ultimately utilise their vehicles as family cars. A 4-door pick-up will never be able to match the sophistication of a unibody SUV, but Mazda’s newcomer demonstrates that “leisure double-cab” standards are rising rapidly.\n\nWe deliver country wide, inhouse financing available.\nThe price excludes dealer fees and smash and grab protection film.
