car to market that just makes sense no matter which way you look at it. An all rounder in every way imaginable. It’s impressively efficient in the city as the electric motor assists with off-the-mark acceleration, which is when a petrol engine is at its least efficient. The vehicle is eerily quiet on pull-off and it’s also impressively refined, even when the petrol engine does kick in. Toyota have had to find a work around for the South African Market as conventional electric cars are a problem with the amount of load shedding we have. A Closed loop hybrid system has proven to be the best option with Toyota leading the way for all other manufacturers. The XS Hybrid model gets full leather seats, dual-zone climate control, Apple Carplay and Android Auto connectivity, cruise control, reverse camera, 17-inch alloy wheels, TFT info display, rain-sensing wipers, LED headlights and fog lights. 3 Year/100 000km Warranty and 6 Year/90 000km Service plan. Toyota have managed to achieve all of this for a relatively low price....
