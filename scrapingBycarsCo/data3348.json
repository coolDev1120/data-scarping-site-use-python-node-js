The Importance And Dynamic Ability Of These Models Are Now Being Recognised By Collectors All Over The World And Prices Have Already Moved Substantially. The 968 Had Visual Ties With It's Predecessors But Was Actually A Substantially Revised And Better Car. It's 3.0 Four Is Very Torquey And Massively Robust. The Four Itself Was Taken From The 928 V8, Essentially One Bank Of That Engine Making It A Real Porsche Product. The Gearbox Is A 6 Speed Manual And Suspension Was Heavily Revised. Several Parts Were From The Revered 964/993 Series. Only Approximately 4 000 Cabriolets were Built Making This A Very RARE Car. This Example Is Appointed In Classic Guards Red With Just Over 100 000 Km And Loads Of Service History Backing This Up. In February 2022 Over 60k Was Spent At M & R Motors On Restoration.
