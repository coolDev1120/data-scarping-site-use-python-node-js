Well, that's not true, but if you looked at the average Ranger on our roads, you might be fooled into thinking so.\nSouth African bakkie enthusiasts wanted the Raptor nameplate on their cars so desperately than many were willing to sacrifice good taste and fitted fake Raptor kits to their bog-standard Rangers.\n\nThankfully, Ford SA has finally introduced the real Ranger Raptor to our market. They're having a hard time convincing the South African public that this really is a special car, and not just a Ranger with some stickers and large tyres.\n\nIn this video https://www.cars.co.za/motoring-news/ford-ranger-raptor-2019-video-review/28808/, we set out on a two-day adventure with the Raptor, and we were left in no doubt that this is one special vehicle.\n\nAs Ciro says, there is just nothing else like it.\n\n","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 12 130.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 68 950.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":1061316825,"count":18,"path":"carsimages","name":"8258083","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Ford","mileage":"106 000 Km","model":"Ranger","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Towbar, Radio, Air bags, Electric Windows, Leather seats, Park distance control, Full service record, Alarm, Xenon lights, Cruise control, Aircon, ABS, Sat nav","price":689500,"province":"North West Province","reference":"","search_type":"B","seller_type":"agent","title":"2020 Ford Ranger 2.0D Bi-Turbo Raptor 4x4 Auto Double-Cab","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"2.0D Bi-Turbo Raptor 4x4 Auto Double-Cab","variant_short":"2.0D","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2020-Ford-Ranger-2.0D-Bi-Turbo-Raptor-4x4-Auto-Double-Cab-North-West-Province-Rustenburg/8258083/","year":2020},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"5788"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8258083"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8258077","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-25.732415,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.290928,"agent_locality":"Pretoria","agent_name":"Auto Xtreme","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"SUV","body_type_code":"SUV","colour":"White","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"Full Service History with Land Rover, Balance of Motor Plan, Panoramic Sun Roof, Cruise Control, Reverse Camera, Navigation, Rain Sensor, Park Distance Control Front and Rear, Electric Boot Lid, Tow Bar, Keyless Go, Electric Seats, Auto Lights, Xenon Lights, Paddle Shift, Lane Keep Assist, Voice Command, Multi Function Steering Wheel, Touch Screen Radio, Bluetooth, USB, Climate Control, Electric Windows, Electric Mirrors, Remote Central Locking.\n\nJan 065 873 6883, Sharon 082 601 6891, Gerald 060 805 7659, Leanie 076 619 1788, Doepie 062 144 8101, Wikkie 076 298 6994.
