In my opinion, the Chinese manufacturers are now where the Koreans were 10 years ago when they launched the new generation KIA SPORTAGE and HYUNDAI IX35. They were making a good quality product at an affordable price. The Koreans are still making a good product but the price is no longer so affordable with their entry level S.U.Vs selling for over R400 000. Enter the BAIC X25. It is just such a cool S.U.V. ALL THE MODERN FEATURES AND LUXURIES INCLUDING TOUCH SCREEN INFOTAINMENT WITH FULLY INTEGRATED SMART PHONE CONNECTIVITY. FASHION ALLOY WHEELS, ELECTRIC GLASS SUNROOF, Just such a beautiful looking S.U.V. The lines are just gorgeous. Make no mistake, the build quality and overall feel of this vehicle is also brilliant.
