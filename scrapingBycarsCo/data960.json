First, the Boxster offers more cargo area than any of its competitors due to the inclusion of front and rear trunks. This front/rear trunk design produces an impressive 9.1 cubic feet of cargo space, and is made possible by the mid-engine design. Second, the Boxster's liveable cockpit has a good deal of space for two occupants and features wonderful, cradling seats. For safety, side airbags are standard and roll bars are built in behind the seats. Finally, the Boxster has the fastest closing automatic top in the business, going from completely open to completely closed in a scant twelve seconds -- perfect for those unexpected rain showers. A stiff, strong body, underpinned by an agile chassis means the Boxster has good crash protection. Nimble, responsive handling means it can get out of danger if driven capably, its big powerful brakes will get it stopped when threatened, and the body structure will stand up when all is lost.\nE&OE","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":3524570649,"count":20,"path":"carsimages","name":"8312884","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Porsche","mileage":"151 771 Km","model":"Boxster","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":189995,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"Blo1710","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"1999 Porsche Boxster (986)","transmission":"Manual","variant":"(986)","variant_short":"","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/1999-Porsche-Boxster-986-Western-Cape-Cape-Town/8312884/","year":1999},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"1691"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8312884"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8312882","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.10089372,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.23287529,"agent_locality":"Kempton Park","agent_name":"Nolly Motors","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Hatchback","body_type_code":"H/B","colour":"RED","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"Used cars for sale in Kempton park, JHB.\nWe deal with all kinds of used cars ( Cash & Vehicle Bank Finance  available)VW POLO VIVO 1.4(Note Additional Fees On Bank Finance) Aircon, Airbags, Radio, USB, AUX, ABS.
