You snooze you lose! Don’t Miss Out!\nWe have sold a lot of these cars throughout the years and will continue to for many years to come, we know them very well, and we used to sell a lot of them, but slowly the supply has dwindled, and it’s becoming harder and harder to find the true clean ones, so when we do find them we buy them.  What vehicle can you buy for this price that competes with this car in terms of reliability, comfort and off road capability? \nI’ll tell you for me a Full Toyota Service history is priceless, There are a few of these available in South Africa at the moment, but I can promise you that only a handful will compete with this one in terms of condition and a full agent history.  You will not find one in this condition very easily, that I can promise you. If you have been looking I’m sure you have seen a few, please trust me when I tell you that this is a special car.\nWHAT MAKES THIS CAR SPECIAL?\n\n•\tFull service history from Toyota  (PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT ITEM)\n•\tOne Owner from new\n•\tIron Man roof rack\n•\tAlmost new A/T tyres \n•\tSpotless condition\n•\tThe fact that the cleanest ones out there are becoming harder and harder to find in this condition\n•\tAll 4 A/T tyres are in excellent condition \n\nThese are one of my favorite vehicles to buy and sell, we have sold a lot of them and know them well, and we have learnt ow to only pick the best ones around and what to look for when buying. We know a good clean Prado when we see one, if you want a very clean Prado with Full Toyota History, Please come through and test drive this one. \n\nWHAT WAS WRONG WITH THIS CAR WHEN WE BOUGHT IT?\n•\tFront bumper had a few scratches, we have resprayed it\n•\tThe driver’s door had a scratch that was not small enough to leave and it just didn’t fit the rest of the condition, so we decided to respray the driver’s door\n•\tThere are no 3rd row seats, the previous owner removed them for travelling because it’s much easier to load stuff in the boot with them out, and they disappeared\n\nShe was extremely clean to start, not to many like this out there anymore, give us a call today to arrange a test drive and a viewing you won’t be sorry. \n\n","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":2871248942,"count":24,"path":"carsimages","name":"8320300","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Toyota","mileage":"258 000 Km","model":"Prado","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":249950,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"Vensol","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2007 Toyota Prado 4.0 V6 VX Auto Full Toyota Service History","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"4.0 V6 VX Auto Full Toyota Service History","variant_short":"4.0 V6","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2007-Toyota-Prado-4.0-V6-VX-Auto-Full-Toyota-Service-History-Gauteng-Sandton/8320300/","year":2007},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"6450"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8320300"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8320299","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.04902641,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.05977757,"agent_locality":"Sandton","agent_name":"Car Sales Exclusive","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"SUV","body_type_code":"SUV","colour":"Black ","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"2010 LAND ROVER RANGE ROVER SPORT 5.0 V8 S|C, ONLY 134 850 KM’S, IMMACULATE CONDITION, SELLING FOR ONLY R 279 950.00\n\nYes please! One of my favorite sounds in the world =  \n \nThe Supercharged 5.0L V8 is truly an impressive power plant with 375 Kw and 625 Nm of torque, as your right foot firmly reaches the floor, yourself, your passengers and the 2,644-kg SUV will reach 100 km/h in 6.2 seconds, and in the same breath it’s one of the most luxurious and capable 4x4’s out there and could tackle just about anything you can throw at it. It’s a very impressive vehicle. \nIt’s crazy to think that a new Range Rover Sport will cost you R 2.5 Mill, and you can purchase such a clean Range Rover like this one for only R 279 950.00, this engine is still strong, the interior is spotless, it’s very hard to find the clean ones like this anymore. I simply love them, I love the power and the sound that comes with it, when you put your foot down there is no hesitation, this vehicle immediately sucks you back into your seat, no matter what gear you are in. \n\nWHAT MAKES THIS CAR SO SPECIAL? \n\n•\tI would definitely start with the interior and exterior condition of this car\n•\tAll preventative and usual LR maintenance issues have been tested by various suppliers of ours, and have all given the vehicle an exceptional bill of health, we have had to replace a few items on the way. \n•\tBrand new tyres \n•\tNo scratches or dents \n•\tInterior like new \n•\tSuspension is perfect \nWithout a doubt one of my favourite cars to come out of the Land Rover line up, value for money you will not be able to find a more luxurious and capable 4x4 out there, only those that have spent time with one will understand the feeling I am trying to express. \n\nWHAT WAS WRONG WITH THE CAR WHEN WE BOUGHT IT?\n\n•\tThe front bumper had a deep scratch in it, we have resprayed the front bumper\n•\tKnocking noise when you turn the steering wheel, we have replaced the steering bushes\n•\tHand Brake not engaging (Typical LR issue), we are repairing that as I write this. \n•\tThere is no parcel shelf\n•\tPartial service history, its missed 3 services, service history from Land Rover goes up to 2018 90 000 Km’s cannot find invoices for the undocumented services, major service in Feb this year.\n•\tPrevious cosmetic paint work detected on the left rear fender, no need to redo its done very well. \n\nThis is a very clean example of what a 2010 Range Rover Sport should look and drive, give us a call or drop a WhatsApp for more info and to schedule an appointment for a viewing. \n","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":124862223,"count":1,"path":"carsimages","name":"8320299","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Land Rover","mileage":"134 860 Km","model":"Range Rover Sport","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":279950,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"Vensol","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2010 Land Rover Range Rover Sport 5.0 V8 S|C","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"5.0 V8 S|C","variant_short":"5.0 V8","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2010-Land-Rover-Range-Rover-Sport-5.0-V8-SC-Gauteng-Sandton/8320299/","year":2010},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"6450"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8320299"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8320298","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.267424,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.059573,"agent_locality":"Johannesburg","agent_name":"Haval JHB The Glen","agent_vin_required":"1","colour":"Blue","condition":"Excellent","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":4033113954,"count":14,"path":"carsimages","name":"8320298","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Suzuki","mileage":"1 500 Km","model":"S-Presso","new_or_used":"Used","options":"ABS, Air bags, Aircon, Full service record, Radio, Park distance control","price":149900,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"022669","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2022 Suzuki S-Presso 1.0 GL","transmission":"Manual","variant":"1.0 GL","variant_short":"1.0","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2022-Suzuki-S-Presso-1.0-GL-Gauteng-Johannesburg/8320298/","year":2022},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"4336"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8320298"}}]
