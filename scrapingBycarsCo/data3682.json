There were new front fenders, lower roofline, and full wheel cut-outs. Mounted under the bonnet was a V8 engine that displaced 327 cubic-inches and produced 255 horsepower, thanks in-part to the Carter four-barrel carburetors. There was an automatic transmission, independent front suspension, and four-wheel hydraulic drum brakes. Our Ambassador is equipped with factory air conditioning, power steering, power windows, a continental kit and power antenna. The seats even fold into a bed. Proudly wearing it's \"T\" ( Transvaal ) number plates, this Nash has been a part of a private car collection for the last 40 years. One of only four V8 known In SA, this rare and unique vehicle will be star of any significant car collecton.  \nFor more information contact Contact Chris 083 34 01 011, Vasco 082 87 95 205, Manni 083 22 77 294,  Thulie 083 24 33 24 Or Fuzzy 083 21 46 572.
