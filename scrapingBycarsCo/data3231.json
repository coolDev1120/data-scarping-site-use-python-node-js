This has to be in my top 5 of “cleanest Mercs ever seen”.\n\nNow please don’t judge and say she is old, it’s a 2006 how can you ask so much money for her, I’ll tell you my opinion, when was the last time you browsed the used car websites and taken a look at what R 159 950.00 gets you in terms of luxury, safety, reliability, build quality, ETC, have you actually physically been out to see some of these cars then you will understand where I am coming from.  This vehicle was built correctly from the start, they do not make them like this anymore. The motor still sounds and feels absolutely brilliant, she goes like a rocket and cruises like a boat. \n\nThe maintenance is not terrible on one of these also, in my humble opinion this is one of the strongest and most reliable sedans Mercedes has produced. The fuel consumption will be a lot more than a plastic car if you are using it for town driving, but if you are driving on a high way every day, this would be like heaven in terms of comfort and fuel consumption will be low also. \n\nWHAT MAKES THIS CAR SO SPECIAL? \n\n•\tOriginal medical kit still intact after all these years\n•\tInterior is like new \n•\tExterior is like new\n•\tAll 4 Michelin tyres are in new condition\n•\tThere are no scratches or dents through the exterior of the car\n•\tThere are no cuts or cracks on the interior of the car\n•\tOne in a million condition\n\nI have the luxury of driving and testing some very nice cars every day, and I can take any car I like home, but this is the car that a recon I have used more than any, I just love it. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":1512727991,"count":14,"path":"carsimages","name":"8038045","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Mercedes-Benz","mileage":"185 000 Km","model":"E-Class","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":159950,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"Vensol","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2006 Mercedes-Benz E-Class E 350","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"E 350","variant_short":"E 350","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2006-Mercedes-Benz-E-Class-E-350-Gauteng-Sandton/8038045/","year":2006},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"6450"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8038045"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8038033","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.710585,"agent_coords_1_coord":27.846779,"agent_locality":"Vanderbijlpark","agent_name":"Just Carz","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"SUV","body_type_code":"SUV","colour":"SILVER","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"IMMACULATE CONDITION.
