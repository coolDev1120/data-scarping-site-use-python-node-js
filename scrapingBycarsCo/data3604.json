The greatest 'Q' car ever and recognised around the world for the classic it is. These cars were handbuilt at the factory, taking 5 times as long to complete as any other saloon in conjunction with Porsche who redesigned the chassis , suspension and drive train. The widened front wings  did not fit the W124 assembly line so the cars had to be assembled by Porsche. An interesting time in history for Porsche. As they completed this project they went on to do the same for Audi with the RS2, using the same department and the same men to produce the next instant classic. The 500e is in impeccable condition and has had but 3 owners in 30 years, all of which i know and respect for preserving such a car. There are only 4 known in this country. An excellent investment, and a very useful moveable asset not to mention the pride of anyones collection........
