Its lightweight keeps it going strong over mud, through sand, and up steep slippery slopes where heavier 4X4s tend to get stuck. The Jimny can climb over most obstacles and steep hills without scraping its bumpers or underbody, thanks to an ample approach angle, ramp breakover angle, departure angle, as well as plenty of ground clearance. From the very first generation, the Jimny has always featured a rigid ladder frame chassis that offers a solid foundation for serious off-road performance. All trade ins are welcomed. In house finance is available. Nationwide delivery can be arranged.\n\n \n\nThe new Jimny comes with a range of protective advances to keep you safe out in the wild or in the city.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":399840330,"count":17,"path":"carsimages","name":"8117694","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Suzuki","mileage":"900 Km","model":"Jimny","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":364900,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"301816","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2022 Suzuki Jimny 1.5 GL","transmission":"Manual","variant":"1.5 GL","variant_short":"1.5","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2022-Suzuki-Jimny-1.5-GL-Western-Cape-Paarl/8117694/","year":2022},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3643"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8117694"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8117691","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-33.728044,"agent_coords_1_coord":18.963158,"agent_locality":"Paarl","agent_name":"Novel Ford Paarl","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Double Cab Bakkie","body_type_code":"D/C","colour":"White","commercial_type":"ab","condition":"Excellent","description":"The Ford Ranger is one of South Africans most popular bakkies and rightfully so.
