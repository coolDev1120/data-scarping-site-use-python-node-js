ML320 CDI gets decent mileage compared to other luxury SUVs, and the engine gives it solid acceleration. Air suspension and all-wheel drive give it off-road capability. We also like the voice-command interface and the navigation system's route guidance.\n\nWe associate Mercedes-Benz with big, luxury cars, but the 2007 Mercedes-Benz ML320 CDI breaks through that image with its diesel engine and serious off-road gear. This car can go over boulder-strewn rutted dirt roads. As for its diesel engine, Mercedes-Benz does a good job of keeping it a secret. The engine runs quietly and smoothly.\n\nThe cabin of the ML320 CDI has all the luxury we would expect from a Mercedes-Benz, even if it is meant to handle wild and wooly off-roading. Of course, the seats are power-adjustable, and the windows require just one touch of the switch to go all the way up or down. And there is a bit of wood trim on the ML320, covering the lower half of the stack and leading down to the console. \n\nThis vehicle has a OneNav system installed aswell to the value of R15 000. \n\nThis vehicle is in excellent condition, the motor was replaced 20 000Km ago.
