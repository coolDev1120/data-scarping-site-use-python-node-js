cool and understated styling with high levels of build quality. Compared with the BMW 3 Series of the same era, the A4’s looks are more sophisticated and executive than edgy, and should stand the test of time. A distinctive single-frame grille endows it with a strong character. Its 16-inch footwear could be why the ride isn’t as firm as it could have been.\n\nIn the A4 hierarchy, the 1.8T sits between the 2-litre and the more expensive turbocharged 2-litre FSI. The 1.8T offers a compromise between comfort, power and performance. But regardless of the engine tag, the clean styling of the A4 turns heads on the road.\n\nA peek into its cabin reveals an attractive landscape. The A4’s interior is simply executed, yet has mild concessions to vanity, something not seen on earlier Audis, which were purely functional.\n\nFeel free to get in contact with us today.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":4260069034,"count":8,"path":"carsimages","name":"8333582","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Audi","mileage":"203 000 Km","model":"A4","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":79995,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2007 Audi A4 1.8 T Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"1.8 T Auto","variant_short":"1.8 T","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2007-Audi-A4-1.8-T-Auto-Western-Cape-Cape-Town/8333582/","year":2007},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3172"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8333582"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8333581","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-33.927674,"agent_coords_1_coord":18.435416,"agent_locality":"Cape Town","agent_name":"Dart Motors","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Sedan","body_type_code":"S/D","colour":"Silver","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Good","description":"The Civic DX, LX and EX models are powered by a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 140 horsepower and 128 pound-feet of torque.

The Civic's suspension, steering and brakes all work together seamlessly, and it's clear that Honda's design ethos has regard for some mild sporting character. It's also a simple car to drive, with intuitive response to inputs and controls falling readily at hand.\n\nThis vehicle is in excellent condition and has full service history!!!\n\nFeel free to get in contact with us today.\n\n","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":2330742332,"count":8,"path":"carsimages","name":"8333581","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Honda","mileage":"69 000 Km","model":"Civic","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":129995,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"547","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2007 Honda Civic 1.8 EXi Sedan Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"1.8 EXi Sedan Auto","variant_short":"1.8","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2007-Honda-Civic-1.8-EXi-Sedan-Auto-Western-Cape-Cape-Town/8333581/","year":2007},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3172"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8333581"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8333579","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.813653,"agent_coords_1_coord":27.829502,"agent_name":"Dutton Volkswagen","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Double Cab Bakkie","body_type_code":"D/C","colour":"White","commercial_type":"ab","condition":"New","description":"A MUST SEE!!!\nCOME AND VIEW!!!\n\nFINANCE CAN BE ARRANGED , TRADE-INS WELCOME!\n\nDUTTON VOLKSWAGEN , A TOP ESTABLISHED NAME IN THE VEHICLE SALES INDUSTRY , SUPPLYING THE BEST DEAL’S AND SERVICE TO OUR CUSTOMERS FOR THE LAST 65 YEAR’S , ON NEW AND USED VEHICLE’S! \nT&C'S APPLY!","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 17 590.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 99 990.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":2218247694,"count":9,"path":"carsimages","name":"8333579","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Volkswagen","mileage":"25 Km","model":"Amarok","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Air bags, Electric Windows, Leather seats, Park distance control, Climate control, Alarm, Xenon lights, Cruise control, Aircon, ABS","price":999900,"province":"Free State","reference":"new amarok ","search_type":"B","seller_type":"agent","title":"2022 Volkswagen Amarok 3.0 TDI Highline (190kW) 4Motion Auto Double-Cab","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"3.0 TDI Highline (190kW) 4Motion Auto Double-Cab","variant_short":"3.0 TDI","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2022-Volkswagen-Amarok-3.0-TDI-Highline-190kW-4Motion-Auto-Double-Cab-Free-State/8333579/","year":2022},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"1774"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8333579"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8333578","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-30.79904724,"agent_coords_1_coord":30.39758702,"agent_name":"Halfway Toyota Shelly Beach","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"SUV","body_type_code":"SUV","colour":"WHITE","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 12 310.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 69 990.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":4260069034,"count":12,"path":"carsimages","name":"8333578","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Toyota","mileage":"107 000 Km","model":"Fortuner","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Towbar, Radio, Air bags, Electric Windows, Leather seats, Full service record, Alarm, Aircon, ABS","price":699900,"province":"Kwazulu Natal","reference":"10UPV14763","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2020 Toyota Fortuner 2.8 GD-6 4x4 Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"2.8 GD-6 4x4 Auto","variant_short":"2.8","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2020-Toyota-Fortuner-2.8-GD-6-4x4-Auto-Kwazulu-Natal/8333578/","year":2020},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"1924"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8333578"}}]
