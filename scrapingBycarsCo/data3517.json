cabin with understated good looks. The interior has been suitably smartened up. The leather seats (specific to the  top of the range Elegance Model), 6.8-inch touchscreen display with Bluetooth, USB and HDMI ports, plus screen-mirroring for smart devices makes it feel extremely user friendly and modern inside. A personal standout for me is the piano black, touch sensitive climate control setup.\n\nHonda has created such a good reputation with their V-tec engines over the years, and they continue to do so with this derivative. Nippy, Practical, Packed with kit, spacious and fuel efficient. Although not often mentioned these days in order to drive up the sales of cheaply built cars who shall remain unnamed, Honda pride themselves in occupant safety, earning the HR-V a 5 Star safety rating.\n\nThis Particular example has only covered 46 000kms with full service records from the agents. New tyres, not a single bump or scratch. Cheap to run, and even cheaper to maintain, its hard to find a better alternative. \n\nThe Cars.co.za recommended retail price new was indicated at R517 900 in 2017. Somebody else has done the next owner a favor by taking the big depreciation hit. An absolute no brainer at R319000\n\nFinance is available.","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 5 260.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 29 890.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":1051122653,"count":24,"path":"carsimages","name":"7838585","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Honda","mileage":"46 000 Km","model":"HR-V","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":298888,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2017 Honda HR-V 1.8 Elegance Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"1.8 Elegance Auto","variant_short":"1.8","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2017-Honda-HR-V-1.8-Elegance-Auto-Gauteng-Randburg/7838585/","year":2017},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"381"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/7838585"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"7838572","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-25.7126609,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.283196,"agent_locality":"Pretoria","agent_name":"Sunward Motors","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Double Cab Bakkie","body_type_code":"D/C","colour":"WHITE","commercial_type":"ab","condition":"Excellent","description":"","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 9 680.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 54 990.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":671214626,"count":11,"path":"carsimages","name":"7838572","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Toyota","mileage":"49 091 Km","model":"Hilux","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":549900,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"8966","search_type":"B","seller_type":"agent","title":"2019 Toyota Hilux 2.8 GD-6 Raised Body Raider Double-Cab","transmission":"Manual","variant":"2.8 GD-6 Raised Body Raider Double-Cab","variant_short":"2.8","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2019-Toyota-Hilux-2.8-GD-6-Raised-Body-Raider-Double-Cab-Gauteng-Pretoria/7838572/","year":2019},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"2400"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/7838572"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"7838441","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.075159,"agent_coords_1_coord":27.975585,"agent_locality":"Randburg","agent_name":"Strijdom Park Unitrans Volkswagen","body_type":"SUV","body_type_code":"SUV","colour":"Silver","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Showroom ","description":"VW STRIJDOM PARK, FERNDALE, RANDBURG.
