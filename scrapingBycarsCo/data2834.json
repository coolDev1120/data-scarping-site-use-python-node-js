It rides comfortably, is spacious and practical, and can cope with a bit of rough terrain thrown its direction. The X-Trail is a good choice of SUV for the family that wants a bit of everything.\nThe 2-litre petrol has a 106 kW and 200 Nm of torque and the manual six-speed gearbox is a light shifter and particularly easy to get in and out of gear.\nThe boot is quite large at 550-litres and with the seats folded down that increases to 1405-litres. They haven't skimped on safety and this X-Trail comes with ABS, traction control, airbags everywhere and hill start assist.\nThe Nissan X-Trail has an extremely comfortable ride, it's cushioned over bumps and soaks up dirt roads with aplomb. The X-Trail's steering feels communicative and does a good job over the rougher stuff of being nice and light. On the road it's still nicely weighted and inspires confidence on freeways that you have total control. It's a family vehicle that's comfortable and capable.\n\nFinance available and\nTrade ins welcome","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":4042123461,"count":12,"path":"carsimages","name":"8144433","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Nissan","mileage":"156 000 Km","model":"X-Trail","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":199900,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2014 Nissan X-Trail 2.0 XE (T32)","transmission":"Manual","variant":"2.0 XE (T32)","variant_short":"2.0","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2014-Nissan-X-Trail-2.0-XE-T32-Western-Cape-Strand/8144433/","year":2014},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3558"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8144433"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8144427","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.709894,"agent_coords_1_coord":27.826712,"agent_featured":"2","agent_locality":"Vanderbijlpark","agent_name":"Ultimate Auto","agent_vin_required":"0","body_type":"Hatchback","body_type_code":"H/B","colour":"SILVER","commercial_type":"a","condition":"GOOD","description":"","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":3702357791,"count":8,"path":"carsimages","name":"8144427","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Kia","mileage":"93 435 Km","model":"Rio","new_or_used":"Used","options":"  Air Bag/s; A/C; ABS; E/W; Exe/Pack; FSH; Leather; Mags; One Owner; P/S; S/Grab; Hatch; 5DR; C/Lock; R/FCD; T/Windows; MF/Steering; E/Mirrors; PDC;  ","price":189900,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"KNADN512LF6564179","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2015 Kia Rio 1.4 Tec 5-dr","transmission":"Manual","variant":"1.4 Tec 5-dr","variant_short":"1.4","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2015-Kia-Rio-1.4-Tec-5-dr-Gauteng-Vanderbijlpark/8144427/","year":2015},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"4368"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8144427"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8144415","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-25.87174,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.194638,"agent_featured":"0","agent_locality":"Centurion","agent_name":"Hyundai Centurion","body_type":"SUV","body_type_code":"SUV","colour":"Fiery Red","commercial_type":"a","condition":"","description":"VENUE 1.0 TGDI MOTION LIMITED ED.
