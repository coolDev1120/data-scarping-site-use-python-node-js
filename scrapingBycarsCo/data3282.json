You will be very impressed with everything it offers and how well it drives. \nWe sell a lot of these and there is a good reason for that, they are good reliable luxury SUV’s. If you like a bit of power in your diesel engine then you will enjoy this car, the drive is smooth and power effortless, we have found them to be reliable and the problems that do turn up over time in our experience are not major and easily repaired. \nThese cars are also fantastic on diesel if you drive her nicely, you really do get the best of all 3 worlds: power, fuel efficiency and comfort. It’s also obviously the Quattro which means you get AWD making it a very nice SUV to drive anywhere.\nWHAT MAKES THIS CAR SPECIAL? \n•\tSpare keys\n•\tAll Wheel Drive \n•\tPanoramic glass sliding roof \n•\tPush button boot open \n•\tSmash and grab safety film \n•\tTow bar \n•\tAll four tyres are in excellent condition\n•\t7 seater \n•\tFull S-Line package\n•\tFull Black pack with red callipers \nWHAT WAS WRONG WITH THIS CAR WHEN WE BOUGHT IT?\n•\tWe had noticed this vehicle when it came in it must have had some previous cosmetic paintwork done to it, it wasn’t up to our standard so we had to respray the following panels: Drivers door, left rear fender, front bumper. \n•\tScratches were also noted on the bonnet and left rear door, these were also resprayed. \n\nCONCLUSION\nThis is a great car to own, it’s certainly got the looks and it’s also a 7 seater diesel auto with AWD (All wheel drive). \n","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 6 860.00</strong> over 72
