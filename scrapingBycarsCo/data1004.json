It’s amazing to me how this BME diesel engine performs, Please don’t think because it’s a diesel it’s slow. These 1 series diesel motors move nicely when you want them to, and the best thing about this car is that no matter how hard or soft you drive it its always sitting under 7ltrs per 100 Km’s. \nThis is also the face lift version, it was only released in 2016. You simply cannot compare the looks of the facelift to the previous generation. Some people might say this is high mileage for a 2016, but it’s not, these cars sell for a high price, if this car had 80 000 Km’s I would be selling it for well over R300K. Also this motor is seriously one of the most reliable engines to come out of the BMW stable, so much more reliable than its petrol derivative. \nMe personally I feel that the only thing this car is missing is a nice set of tinted windows, then it will look perfect in my eyes. So if the new owner decides they want tinted windows, we will fit them on us, that’s it FREE SMASH AND GRAB ON US. And we only use the best Auto Armor. \nWHAT MAKES THIS CAR SPECIAL\n•\tBrand New 18 inch M-Sport Wheels\n•\tFace lift version\n•\tSunroof\n•\tUnder 5 LTRS Per 100 Km’s on the open road \n•\tFull BMW factory leather interior\n•\tBluetooth\n•\tPark distance control \n","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 4 570.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 26 000.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":1703764855,"count":17,"path":"carsimages","name":"8311037","extension":".jpg"},"make":"BMW","mileage":"149 800 Km","model":"1 Series","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":259950,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"Vensol","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2016 BMW 1 Series 120d 5-dr Sport Line","transmission":"Manual","variant":"120d 5-dr Sport Line","variant_short":"120d","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2016-BMW-1-Series-120d-5-dr-Sport-Line-Gauteng-Sandton/8311037/","year":2016},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"6450"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8311037"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8311030","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-25.832971,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.208946,"agent_locality":"Centurion","agent_name":"Competitive Cars (PTY) Ltd","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"SUV","body_type_code":"SUV","colour":"WHITE","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Good","description":"2014 Kia Sportage 2.0 CRDi Auto / only 93,000km With FSH by Kia / Electric driver seat / Reverse Cam / PDC / LED Xennon Headlights / Black Leather / MFS / Bluetooth / Accident free !!!
