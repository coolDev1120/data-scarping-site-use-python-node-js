The MINI is still a very small car, but it's one that's improving with the years, while keeping the distinctive looks, cheeky character, and roller-skate handling of previous generations very much intact. On the outside, only the longer nose really betrays the complete redesign. It's gained slightly in every dimension, and visually, a longer hood and less stubby front indicate the new crash structures and stronger bodyshell underneath. But the upright windshield, long roof, horizontal window line, and oval front lights all still resemble the MINI. The interior is where the most visible changes have come. The ergonomics are cleaned up, with a tachometer and speedometer behind the steering wheel at last, and the large round central dashboard shape now solely a display screen. Three rotating knobs handle the ventilation system, and overall it's simply much easier to understand how the controls work. With a full Dekra condition and roadworthy report.

A 2 year WARRANTY is included in this price. What does the 2019 Toyota Quantum 2.5 D-4D LWB F/C P/V have to offer you. The overall length and passenger space has increased and there's a bit more leg room and improved seating comfort. At the front the Quantum has LED daytime running lights, fog lights and color-coded bumpers. There are also 16-inch steel wheels, as well as new large mirrors which are power retractable. Ride quality, all-important for a vehicle that’s main job is transporting passengers has been significantly improved thanks to new suspension. The additional width and length of the vehicle also adds to the passenger comfort levels, with better legroom and headroom, while the sliding door has been made 70mm wider for easier access. Active safety systems include Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), which ensure that the maximum braking power is produced without locking the tyres and distributes optimal braking force to the left and right wheels. Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) suppresses a sudden loss of vehicle stability during cornering; and when on an incline the Hill-Assist Control (HAC) system will temporarily keep the vehicle from rolling back. So if you are needing a commuting vehicle, this one is for you. With full Dekra roadworthy and condition report.

Below these is a redesigned diffuser element in the same titanium grey, creating the presence of width and stability. The interior has been lifted to separate the GT-Line from the rest of the range so that you're reminded of the differences. The GT-Line is fitted with a 7-inch touchscreen infotainments system that runs Renault's MediaNav, Bluetooth, AUX- and USB-inputs. This Clio range carries the highest accolade of a full 5 stars rating being in the top five of the safest cars in the country. Fitted with 4 airbags and Anti-lock brakes, brake force distribution, emergency brake assist, traction control and hill start assist. Finally, it is the sporty looking car without the harsh ride, exorbitant fuel consumption and impracticality and rather delivers a sensible approach for those who still want to have fun.
