These are one of my favourite 7 seater SUV’s out there, they are made to last and if you maintain them like this one has been they will do a million Km’s with ease. \nThis special car is a 2 owner vehicle, the previous owner has owned it for the last 16 years, and it was their holiday vehicle. It’s got a full service history which is a must when looking to purchase one of these. Trust me you will struggle to find another one like this in this price range, and yes sure you can get a cheaper 2005 Prado but I promise you it’s not like this and you will probably end up spending a lot more money getting it into this shape. \nThis particular one has some extremely nice extra’s that come with it. If you are in the market for a quality well maintained 4x4 then you have to come through to see this, you will not regret it. \nWHAT MAKES THIS CAR SO SPECIAL? \n•\tGenuine 2 owner vehicle, even though in my eyes it’s more like a one owner vehicle. \n•\tBF Goodrich tyres are 75% (R 20 000 if bought new) \n•\tIronman snorkel \n•\tAirmax lift suspension for heavy duty trailers (AIRMAX Air Helper Suspension\nFirestone air spring systems are designed to maximize safe load carrying capacity, stability and overall ride quality)\n•\tFull service history (21 services since new mostly by Toyota)\n•\tLED light bar \n•\tAll original tools still in place \n•\tLate 2005, so it has the 5 speed gear box \n•\tInterior is pristine (vehicle had a full valet after every holiday) \n•\tNo expense spared on maintenance (New Oxygen sensors recently replaced by Toyota) \nI love this car and the story behind it, this was a very reluctant sale by the previous owner, and I have promised her that this car will go to a good home. \nWHAT WAS WRONG WITH THIS CAR WHEN WE BOUGHT IT? \n•\tThere are a few slight cracks on the dash, there is no need to redo the dash, they are not bad at all. \n•\tThere has been some previous paintwork noticed on a few panels, but for a 2005 Prado I think that’s to be expected. Never been in an accident only cosmetic repairs to remove scratches, if I didn’t tell you, I highly doubt any one would even pick it up. \n•\tShe needed a good polish, which we do to all of our vehicles anyway. \n•\tOn the boot in the corner there is a small dent, looks like something was jammed in the boot when it was closed\nThat was all, this is one of the cleanest best looked after Prado we have come across in a while. \n\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIf you have been looking at the very many Prado’s currently out there, then you know what I’m talking about when I say that the clean ones are few and far between. Well trust me when I tell you this is the one you have been looking and waiting for. We actually have 3 at the moment and all 3 are special, the other 2 are newer a 2008 (facelift) and a 2007 with 258 000 Km’s, these other two are also very special because they both have full Toyota service history since new, BUT this one is still my favourite. You are getting a fantastic specimen and one of the very few clean ones left. \n","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":929595323,"count":20,"path":"carsimages","name":"8286881","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Toyota","mileage":"284 800 Km","model":"Prado","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":209950,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"Vensol ","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2005 Toyota Prado 4.0 V6 VX Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"4.0 V6 VX Auto","variant_short":"4.0 V6","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2005-Toyota-Prado-4.0-V6-VX-Auto-Gauteng-Sandton/8286881/","year":2005},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"6450"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8286881"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8286880","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-25.748757,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.197747,"agent_locality":"Pretoria","agent_name":"GI Motors","agent_vin_required":"2","body_type":"Sedan","body_type_code":"S/D","colour":"Red","commercial_type":"a","condition":"","description":"First come, first serve!!!
