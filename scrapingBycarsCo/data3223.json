The big advantage is the fuel consumption that’s rated at 5.4 litres/100km –\nand personally, aside from a hybrid, this must be one of the most fuel efficient cars I have ever driven.. The generous\ncabin space is easily accessible from the door openings and once inside you will notice that there is an above-average\namount of headroom. Shoulder room is also rather surprising given the external dimensions of the Sandero Stepway\nTechRoad. Rear legroom is adequate at best with the front seats in a comfortable position.Renault has done well to\nkeep the ageing Stepway relevant and the new additions really do make it an appealing choice.Contact Variety Motors\nfor more inquiries.
