In my opinion, the Chinese manufactures are now where the Koreans were 10 years ago when they launched the new generation KIA SPORTAGE and HYUNDAI IX35. The were making a good quality product at an affordable price. The Koreans are still making a good product but the price is no longer so affordable with their entry level S.U.Vs selling for over R400 000. Enter the BAIC X25. It is just such a cool S.U.V. ALL THE MODERN FEATURES AND LUXURIES INCLUDING TOUCH SCREEN INFOTAINMENT WITH FULLY INTEGRATED SMART PHONE CONNECTIVITY. Just such a beautiful looking S.U.V. The lines are just gorgeous Make no mistake, the build quality and overall feel of this vehicle is also brilliant. THE 11 BILLION SPENT ON A STATE OF THE ART PRODUCTION PLANT IN P.E MEANS THAT THIS MANUFACTURER IS HERE TO STAY. The car comes with a 5 YEAR120 000 KM factory warranty which equals 100 peace of mind motoring We have a fully accredited BAIC workshop on site to cater for all your parts and maintenance needs.
