We certainly think so as not only is the Renault Kwid the physical embodiment of modern French driving, but it is also just as much at home roaring down the highway as it is darting gracefully through the traffic of even the most gridlocked South African cities. It’s robust, yet fun design is 100% technology-driven and this amazingly French vehicle is perfectly suited for South African car lovers who are young or simply young at heart. With its bold, perfectly structured grille that highlights the now legendary Renault diamond logo, this is probably the most affordable piece of sexy French automotive machinery to ever to hit the roads of Africa (and indeed the world).\nFuel frugal and with a low CO2 Emission Level, this Renault Kwid is both cost effective to drive and friendly to the environment. It is a car that has SUV stylings without the higher fuel consumption, it is in fact the perfect car for those who want to be seen, but don’t want a car that literally costs the Earth.\n\nFuel frugal and with a low CO2 Emission Level, this Renault Kwid is both cost effective to drive and friendly to the environment.
