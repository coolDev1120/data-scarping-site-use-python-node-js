Deep-set silver-rimmed dials, as well as a leather steering wheel, are other trademark details that give the cabin a unique feel. Yet while it's comfortable and well laid out, the VW's driving environment isn't as enticing as more exciting rivals - although material quality does give it an expensive air. Rear legroom in the back is reasonable and the 270-litre boot is commodious. The Polo also scores highly with its good seating position and steering wheel that offers both reach and rake adjustment. Running costs seem a mixed bag; group 13 insurance isn't too high for a turbocharged hot hatch, while fuel economy seems middling on paper. A choice of variable or fixed-interval servicing, depending on your circumstances, ensures you won't visit the dealer more than you should - which may offset pricy-looking VW dealer rates. Retained values will be good.\n\nThanks to its 1.8-litre turbocharged engine, performance doesn't disappoint. It has 110kw and a beefy 220Nm of torque, helping it sprint to 100km/h in 8.2 seconds. This is helped by the turbo delivering peak power at 1,950rpm, so the powerplant doesn't have to be worked too hard. In fact, mid-range performance is incredibly strong, and out on the open road, the GTI feels punchy and responsive.\n\nFeel free to get in contact with us today about this pocket rocket!","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":2224169653,"count":8,"path":"carsimages","name":"8333713","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Volkswagen","mileage":"204 000 Km","model":"Polo","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":129995,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"556","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2007 Volkswagen Polo GTI 1.8T","transmission":"Manual","variant":"GTI 1.8T","variant_short":"1.8T","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2007-Volkswagen-Polo-GTI-1.8T-Western-Cape-Cape-Town/8333713/","year":2007},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3172"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8333713"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8333712","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.534956,"agent_coords_1_coord":29.98898,"agent_locality":"Ermelo","agent_name":"Auto Link Inspectacar","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Hatchback","body_type_code":"H/B","colour":"WHITE","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"18'' Alloy Wheels, PDC, LED PLUS LIGHTS W/ HIGH BEAM CONTROL, SUNROOF, Reverse Camera, LEATHER SEATS, MULTI-COLOR DIGITAL COCKPIT, HEATED STEERING, ELECTRIC MEMORY DRIVER's SEAT, FRONT ACTIVE CLIMATE SEATS, LANE CHANGE SYSTEM SIDE ASSIST W/ TRAFFIC ALERT WARNING SYSTEM, HARMAN KARDON SOUND SYSTEM, App Connect, Apple Car Play, USB","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 14 070.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 79 990.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":323025725,"count":16,"path":"carsimages","name":"8333712","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Volkswagen","mileage":"23 000 Km","model":"Golf","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Air bags, Alarm, Cruise control, Radio, Sunroof, Climate control, Leather seats, Park distance control","price":799900,"province":"Mpumalanga","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2022 Volkswagen Golf 8 GTI  2.0 TSI Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"8 GTI  2.0 TSI Auto","variant_short":"2.0 TSI","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2022-Volkswagen-Golf-8-GTI-2.0-TSI-Auto-Mpumalanga-Ermelo/8333712/","year":2022},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"110"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8333712"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8333711","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.207624,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.045965,"agent_locality":"Johannesburg","agent_name":"Auto Cad Motors","agent_vin_required":"2","body_type":"Double Cab Bakkie","body_type_code":"D/C","colour":"BLUE","commercial_type":"ab","condition":"Excellent","description":"The car is in Good condition, and finance is available we are at 109 Anderson and Kruis street Johannesburg.
