Hummer is now gone, and Jeep has honed its Wrangler, but the FJ Cruiser remains one of the better bets for off-road toughness and trail prowess.\nThe FJ blends retro and contemporary so well that its design should be quite ageless. Looking a bit like a vintage 1960s-era FJ40, crossed with modern cues from the 4Runner and Land Cruiser, with a MINI Cooper-like edge, the FJ Cruiser looks ripe for the trail, yet like a stylish accessory that would make as much of a statement parked in front of an outdoor outfitter as in front of Urban Outfitters. Inside, the appointments are intentionally stark, with body-colored panels and simple gauges and sturdy switchgear.","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 7 920.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 44 990.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":2097114341,"count":10,"path":"carsimages","name":"7446941","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Toyota","mileage":"92 000 Km","model":"FJ Cruiser","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":449900,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"16692","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2012 Toyota FJ Cruiser 4.0 V6","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"4.0 V6","variant_short":"4.0 V6","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2012-Toyota-FJ-Cruiser-4.0-V6-Gauteng-Bryanston/7446941/","year":2012},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"5034"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/7446941"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"7446689","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.12159775,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.04713853,"agent_locality":"Sandton","agent_name":"Ayob Motors","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Coupe","body_type_code":"C/P","colour":"","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"One of just 50 units produced in the world !
