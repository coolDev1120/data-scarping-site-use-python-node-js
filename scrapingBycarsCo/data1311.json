Not only is it the best-selling model in the Swedish brandâ€™s lineup, but it is also the best-selling car in its segment in Europe.\nThe Volvo XC60 is a distinctive shape that brings some sportwagon style to the crossover category.\nThe XC60 handles decently. Like the best of crossovers, it handles like a car--which is to say, like a much lower vehicle--and conveys a secure feeling in the corners that inspires driver confidence. With 9.1 inches of ground clearance and a solid Haldex all-wheel drive system, the XC60 has the goods for getting through muddy fields, and even rutted trails and rocky roads.\nThe Volvo XC60 remains one of the best-rated cars on the market for safety. It earned a top five stars overall from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\nThe XC60 is an all-wheel drive 4 door with 5 seats, powered by a 2.4L DIESEL TURBO 5 engine that has 158 kW of power (at 4000 rpm) and 440 Nm of torque (at 1500 rpm) via a 6 SP AUTOMATIC GEARTRONIC.\nThe Volvo XC60 crossover stays stylish.\nThis specific Volvo is a 1 Owner (Dr.) vehicle with full service history at the Agents and is in an immaculate condition\n\nFinance available and\nTrade ins welcome.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":631318670,"count":14,"path":"carsimages","name":"8296168","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Volvo","mileage":"114 000 Km","model":"XC60","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":349900,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2015 Volvo XC60 D5 Momentum Auto AWD","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"D5 Momentum Auto AWD","variant_short":"D5","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2015-Volvo-XC60-D5-Momentum-Auto-AWD-Western-Cape-Strand/8296168/","year":2015},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3558"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8296168"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8296167","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-25.9335536,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.14447656,"agent_locality":"Midrand","agent_name":"Rosso Auto","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Cabriolet","body_type_code":"C/B","colour":"Red","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"Navigation, Reverse Camera, Bose Sound, Android Auto, Keyless, Xenon Headlights, Bluetooth, USB, Seat Heating, Rain Sensor with Auto Lights, Cruise Control, Aircon.
