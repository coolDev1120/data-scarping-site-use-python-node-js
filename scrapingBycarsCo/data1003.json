It was officially unveiled on 8 October 1986 as an all-new, second generation of the XJ to replace the Series III, although the two model ranges were sold concurrently until the Series III was discontinued in 1992. The XJ40 used the Jaguar independent rear suspension arrangement, and featured a number of technological enhancements (such as electronic instrument cluster).[2] The 1993 XJ6 earned the title of \"Safest Car in Britain\" as the result of a government survey.[3] The original 1986 car gave way to the heavily revised X300 model in 1994, followed by the X308 version in 1997. The XJ40 and its later derivatives, is to date, the second longest running Jaguar XJ platform with a total production run of 17 years.\n\nThe Daimler-branded (as seen by this vehicle) cars represented the highest trim level, and were sold as their Vanden Plas model by Jaguar dealers in the United States. Like the Sovereign, it was fitted with the single rectangular headlamps. Cosmetically, it differed from other models with its fluted radiator grille surround, boot-lid plinth and detail finishes. A Daimler interior features fold-out picnic tables for the rear passengers and a 2-passenger rear seat versus the 'flat', 3-passenger item on the Jaguars.\n\nFeel free to contact us about this iconic
