The Tiguan's sized well for the U.S. market, handles capably, and has a neat and clean look that's sure to wear well for years.\n\nAs far as VW cars go, the Tiguan skews on the conservative side of what the brand has produced in recent years–but that includes one of the best-built interiors in its class of compact crossovers. It comes with an interior that's nicer than many of the Volkswagen's other small cars, almost as if the Tiguan was designed from the inside out. Outside, it looks a little like a taller version of a Golf–a little bland for the segment–but the larger wheels offered on the upper trims of the Tiguan help it look a little tougher than a smaller hatchback.\n\nReally, the Tiguan is what it is: a very tall small car with a lot of usefulness, an affordable price, and good gas mileage. This vehicle is probably the best fit for a growing family that wants something with a little more utility, or to the older driver who likes the easier entry/exit and seating position of a city-oriented crossover. Most crossover shoppers also want an interior that's straightforward and versatile—as well as comfortable—and the Tiguan delivers on those expectations. Front seats feel sporty and supportive, with good comfort and an excellent driving position, while the second-row seats slide and tilt, leaving ample space for adults.\n\nThis vehicle has a FULL SERVICE HISTORY included.\n\nFeel free to get in contact with us today.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":1682901312,"count":8,"path":"carsimages","name":"8310997","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Volkswagen","mileage":"188 000 Km","model":"Tiguan","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":189995,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"548","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2014 Volkswagen Tiguan 2.0 TDI Trend&Fun 4Motion Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"2.0 TDI Trend&Fun 4Motion Auto","variant_short":"2.0 TDI","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2014-Volkswagen-Tiguan-2.0-TDI-TrendFun-4Motion-Auto-Western-Cape-Cape-Town/8310997/","year":2014},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3172"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8310997"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8310996","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-34.17071872,"agent_coords_1_coord":22.12186344,"agent_locality":"Mossel Bay","agent_name":"C P Nel Motors","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Hatchback","body_type_code":"H/B","colour":"SILVER","commercial_type":"a","condition":"New","description":"2022 Hyundai I20 1.2 Motion Manual Transmission with 4900km on the clock.
