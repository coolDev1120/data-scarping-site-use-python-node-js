The lights, the bonnet, the rake of the windscreen, as well as the LED tail light clusters and the ‘blades’ along the flanks, are all elements reminiscent of the Porsche brand. The rear treatment, with its generous tailgate, cocky roof spoiler and large-bore exhausts, is rendered with cohesive finesse, expressing a certain level of muscle, without resorting to overkill. The sculpted flanks add to an overall appearance that is lean, rather than mean.\n\nThe interior follows Porsche’s current ergonomic trends, already established in the likes of the 911, Boxster and Cayman. The centre console is an extended, sloping affair endowed with switchgear on either side, while a generous touchscreen display dominates the centre stack.","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 10 120.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 57 500.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":1992107359,"count":12,"path":"carsimages","name":"8276669","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Porsche","mileage":"83 300 Km","model":"Macan","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Towbar, Radio, Air bags, Electric Windows, Leather seats, Park distance control, Full service record, Climate control, Alarm, Cruise control, Aircon, ABS, Sat nav","price":575000,"province":"Kwazulu Natal","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2014 Porsche Macan S Diesel","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"S Diesel","variant_short":"S","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2014-Porsche-Macan-S-Diesel-Kwazulu-Natal-Umhlanga-Rocks/8276669/","year":2014},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"7157"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8276669"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8276667","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-29.8525119,"agent_coords_1_coord":31.0237651,"agent_locality":"Durban","agent_name":"Durban Cars","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Hatchback","body_type_code":"H/B","colour":"WHite","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 6 510.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 37 000.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":4021581029,"count":13,"path":"carsimages","name":"8276667","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Volkswagen","mileage":"119 200 Km","model":"Polo","new_or_used":"Used","options":"Sunroof, Radio, Air bags, Electric Windows, Leather seats, Park distance control, Full service record, Climate control, Alarm, Xenon lights, Cruise control, Aircon, ABS, Sat nav","price":369999,"province":"Kwazulu Natal","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2017 Volkswagen Polo GTI 1.4 TSI Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"GTI 1.4 TSI Auto","variant_short":"1.4 TSI","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2017-Volkswagen-Polo-GTI-1.4-TSI-Auto-Kwazulu-Natal-Durban/8276667/","year":2017},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"6912"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8276667"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8276666","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-23.90089962,"agent_coords_1_coord":29.45103757,"agent_locality":"Polokwane","agent_name":"BB Pre Owned Polokwane","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Hatchback","body_type_code":"H/B","colour":"Silver","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"The perfect vehicle for everyday use!Light on fuel and ample space.\n\nRadio\nPark distance control\nSmash and grab\nAircon\n\nTrade ins welcome and finance available\n\nBBPre Owned Polokwane\nRiaan de Beer\n0825561833","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 2 990.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 16 990.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":1866574899,"count":8,"path":"carsimages","name":"8276666","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Suzuki","mileage":"19 800 Km","model":"Swift","new_or_used":"Used","options":"ABS, Aircon, Electric Windows, Park distance control, Radio, Full service record, Alarm, Air bags","price":169900,"province":"Limpopo","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2022 Suzuki Swift 1.2 GA","transmission":"Manual","variant":"1.2 GA","variant_short":"1.2","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2022-Suzuki-Swift-1.2-GA-Limpopo-Polokwane/8276666/","year":2022},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"6952"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8276666"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8276663","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-25.732415,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.290928,"agent_locality":"Pretoria","agent_name":"Auto Xtreme","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Double Cab Bakkie","body_type_code":"D/C","colour":"White","commercial_type":"ab","condition":"Excellent","description":"Jan 065 873 6883, Sharon 082 601 6891, Gerald 060 805 7659, Leanie 076 619 1788, Doepie 062 144 8101, Celeste 084 500 5938, Wikkie 076 298 6994.
