It’s also stronger, safer, smarter and more capable, and with a class-leading 3.5-tonne towing capacity it’s well positioned to capitalise on surging interests in long trips. With push-button starting, keyless entry, and a 7.0-inch touch-screen with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, bi-LED headlights, an electric park brake and 17-inch alloys with all-terrain tyres. The 2021 Isuzu MU-X has taken both safety and technology to the next level, and the adoption of the IDAS safety suite across the range will surely resonate with buyers.\nThe MU-X’s off-road electronics now include Rough Terrain Mode – an off-road traction mode – as well as hill descent control, while the top-spec LS-T receives tyre pressure monitoring.\nPairing a phone is simple, while the new multimedia unit combines smartphone mirroring, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity with integrated satellite navigation, voice recognition, and regular plus digital radio.\nPlease note that the price does not include smash and grab and dealership fees.\n","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 10 200.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 57 990.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":1780174531,"count":11,"path":"carsimages","name":"8174612","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Isuzu","mileage":"22 520 Km","model":"Mu-x","new_or_used":"Used","options":"4x2,ABS Brakes,Air Conditioning,Airbags,Alarm,Alloy Wheels,Automatic,Auxiliary Audio Input,Bluetooth Ready,Central Locking,Climate Control,Drink Holder,EBD Electronic Brake Distribution,Electric Mirrors,Electric Windows,ESP Electronic Stability Program,Fog Lights,Front Electric Windows,Full Service History,Keyless Go,Leather,LED Daytime Lights,Maintenance Plan,Multi-Function Steering,Parking Sensors,Power Steering,Radio/CD/MP3,Rear Air Conditioning,Roof Rails,Sat Nav,Service Plan,USB Input","price":579900,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"82","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2021 Isuzu Mu-x 3.0D Auto","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"3.0D Auto","variant_short":"3.0D","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2021-Isuzu-Mu-x-3.0D-Auto-Gauteng-Centurion/8174612/","year":2021},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"7020"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8174612"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8174615","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.05858449,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.02420886,"agent_locality":"Sandton","agent_name":"Nabi Investments","agent_vin_required":"0","body_type":"Sedan","body_type_code":"S/D","colour":"Grey","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"SOUTH AFRICAS FAVOURITE M CAR IS BACK AND NOW FEATURES AN X-DRIVE SYSTEM TAKING YOU FROM 0 - 100KM/H REAL QUICK!\n•DRAVIT GREY\n•BLACK MERINO LEATHER\n•M COMPOUND BRAKE RED\n•HIGH BEAM ASSIST\n•19/20 INCH M WHEELS\n•BMW GESTURE CONTROL\n•BMW LIVE COCKPIT\n•COMFORT ACCESS\n•ADAPTIVE M SUSPENSION\n•PARKING & DRIVING ASSIST \n•HARMON KARDON SOUND SYSTEM\n•DRIVER ELECTRIC SEATS WITH MEMORY\n•M DRIVERS PACKAGE\n•NAVIGATION\n•CONNECTED DRIVE\n•BAL OF MOTORPLAN\n-\n-\nKINDLY NOTE PRICE EXCLUDES ON ROAD CHARGES.\nFINANCE AVAILABLE FROM ALL MAJOR BANKS.\nKINDLY NOTE VIEWING IS STRICTLY BY APPOINTMENT.\nWE DELIVER NATIONWIDE.\nTRADE INS WELCOME.","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 35 190.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 200 000.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":1146513954,"count":20,"path":"carsimages","name":"8174615","extension":".jpg"},"make":"BMW","mileage":"10 000 Km","model":"M3","new_or_used":"Used","options":"ABS Brakes,Air Conditioning,Alarm,Alloy Wheels,Automatic,Balance of Factory Warranty,Central Locking,Electric Windows,Front Electric Windows,Full Service History,Immobilizer,iPod Input,Maintenance Plan,Power Steering,Service Plan,USB Input","price":2000000,"province":"Gauteng","reference":"443","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2022 BMW M3 Competition AWD","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"Competition AWD","variant_short":"Competition","vehicle_axle_config":"4X4","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2022-BMW-M3-Competition-AWD-Gauteng-Sandton/8174615/","year":2022},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"6355"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8174615"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8174620","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.05858449,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.02420886,"agent_locality":"Sandton","agent_name":"Nabi Investments","agent_vin_required":"0","body_type":"SUV","body_type_code":"SUV","colour":"Black","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"THE RANGE TOPPING PERFORMANCE SUV AT A FRACTION OF THE PRICE FULLY LOADED WITH CARBON DETAILS.
