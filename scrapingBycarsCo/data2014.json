Toyota\nFinance can be arranged\nTrade in welcome\nDelivery country wide\nToyota introduced a new, Thailand-built Yaris to the market featuring assertive exterior and interior styling. A naturally-aspirated 1.5-litre petrol engine does service under the bonnet with 79 kW and 140 Nm of torque and is offered with a 5-speed manual gearbox. As a result of these changes, mostly its newly chiselled and mature aesthetics, I expect the new Yaris is going to find itself on the shopping radar of more men than any of its predecessors. Yes, it still retains that excellent reliability and fuel economy as before, but the total package and gearing towards a return to the driver’s car means that the new Yaris has far more Y chromosome in its makeup than ever before. And that’s nothing to be ashamed of.","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 3 410.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 19 390.00</strong> at a rate of 12%
