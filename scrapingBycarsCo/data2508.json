The current model has been around for a long time, but for what it lacks in the latest features and safety technologies, it makes up for in value for money. When the 250 D-Max was cruising at speeds of around 120 kph, the transmission felt well-calibrated, with sufficiently prompt responses when it was required to kick down, overtake and coast. Even the engine-braking felt natural and intuitive; my only bugbear was that the drivetrain snatched slightly when shifting down to 1st in congested traffic. For consumers who spend most of their time travelling in urban areas, the self-shifting Isuzu is a credible option at an affordable price.\n\nThe tried-and-trusted 100 kW/320 Nm turbodiesel engine is quite well-matched with the 5-speed automatic transmission and I can imagine that opting for a 6-speed unit instead would have added more cost without any obvious/substantial benefit to drivability. By the way, the claimed average fuel consumption figure for the new auto derivatives is a very respectable 8.1 L/100 km.","finance_estimate":"Estimated monthly payment is <strong>R 7 210.00</strong> over 72 months with 10% deposit of <strong>R 40 990.00</strong> at a rate of 12% (PRIME + 3%).<br /><br />* Please note that these calculations are only estimates and must be confirmed with your finance provider.","fuel_type":"Diesel","image":{"version":3217678387,"count":14,"path":"carsimages","name":"8192116","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Isuzu","mileage":"55 000 Km","model":"D-Max","new_or_used":"Used","options":"ABS, Aircon, Electric Windows, Air bags, Alarm, Full service record, Radio","price":409900,"province":"North West Province","reference":"","search_type":"B","seller_type":"agent","title":"2021 Isuzu D-Max 250 HO Hi-Rider Auto Double-Cab","transmission":"Automatic","variant":"250 HO Hi-Rider Auto Double-Cab","variant_short":"250","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2021-Isuzu-D-Max-250-HO-Hi-Rider-Auto-Double-Cab-North-West-Province-Rustenburg/8192116/","year":2021},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"5788"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8192116"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8192114","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.103377,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.070849,"agent_featured":"2","agent_locality":"Sandton","agent_name":"Chery Sandton","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"SUV","body_type_code":"SUV","colour":"Khaki White","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Excellent","description":"5 Year / 150 000 Km Warranty & 5 Year / 60 000 Km Service Plan. 1 Million Km Or 10 Year Engine Warranty!\n\nFeatures: \nDemo,\n12.3 Inch Digital Instrumentation, \n360º HD Panoramic Imaging Camera, \nCruise Control (Adaptive), \nElectrically Adjustable Exterior Mirror (with memory), \nKeyless Entry and Push Button Start, \nDynamic Cornering Signal, \nPrivacy Glass, \nRear view Camera (with dynamic guides), \nRear Parking Sensors (Park Distance Control), \nSpeed Sensitive Electric Power Steering, \nTyre Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), \n7 Seater, \nHill Assist & Downhill Assist, \nWireless Charging Pad, \nBlack leather Interior, \nCooling Centre Console.\n\nStep in and step up your drive with the all new Tiggo 8 Pro.
