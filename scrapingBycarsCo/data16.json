Buyers need to pick and mix carefully from Ford's accessories range to avoid getting a big bill - particularly when the basic Ka is such great value for money.\n\nCars with big wings and powerful engines may top the wish lists of many young motorists, but hefty insurance premiums make them expensive extras for new drivers. However, for those who want to stand out and still watch the pennies, Ford thinks it may have the answer.\n\nWith all Kas, this machine is great to drive. While the engine offers only 51kw, throttle response is sharp and the car feels faster than the 13.7 seconds 0-100km/h time suggests. The five-speed gearbox is snappy, too, and the steering provides plenty of feedback.\n\nThis vehicle is in excellent condition with a FULL SERVICE HISTORY.","fuel_type":"Petrol","image":{"version":2319453570,"count":8,"path":"carsimages","name":"8347197","extension":".jpg"},"make":"Ford","mileage":"130 000 Km","model":"Ka","new_or_used":"Used","options":"","price":55995,"province":"Western Cape","reference":"537","search_type":"A","seller_type":"agent","title":"2006 Ford Ka Trend","transmission":"Manual","variant":"Trend","variant_short":"Trend","vehicle_axle_config":"4X2","website_url":"https://www.cars.co.za/for-sale/used/2006-Ford-Ka-Trend-Western-Cape-Cape-Town/8347197/","year":2006},"relationships":{"seller":{"data":{"type":"seller","id":"3172"}}},"links":{"self":"https://api.cars.co.za/fw/public/v3/vehicle/8347197"}},{"type":"vehicle","id":"8347196","attributes":{"agent_coords_0_coord":-26.219713,"agent_coords_1_coord":28.033924,"agent_locality":"Johannesburg","agent_name":"Cedar Motors","agent_vin_required":"1","body_type":"Multi Purpose Vehicle","body_type_code":"MPV","colour":"White","commercial_type":"a","condition":"Good","description":"Nice all-round family vehicle,Safe and comfortable\n\nPOWER STEERING-\nELECTIRC WINDOWS-\nELECTRIC MIRRIORS-\nFACTORY FITTED CD FRONT-\nAIR CONDITIONING-\nFULL SERVICE HISTORY-\nSPARE KEYS-\n\nCEDAR MOTORS IS A WHOLESALER TO THE PUBLIC.\nOUR AIM IS TO PROVIDE OUR CLIENTS WITH AFFORDABLE \nVEHICLES.
