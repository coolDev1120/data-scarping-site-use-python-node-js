Here is a very original version of the P5 Rover. You dont see very many of these old girls around anymore. The vehicle is 60 years old and simply has been maintained rather than pulled apart, never to be the same again. This early example [ manuf. 1959 ] enjoys its original engine and gearbox, it being a 3 litre six  and a 4 speed manual. These cars were incredibly well made and consequently were favourites with royalty and politicians alike. They were built pre British Leyland so we still had the quality and pride built into them. The car runs well, as all old cars do that havent been messed with. The body and interior are original [ read old ] so it wont be winning any club concours any time soon, but its a useable classic  that you dont have to be too precious with.
