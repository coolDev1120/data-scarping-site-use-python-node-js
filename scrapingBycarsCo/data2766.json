An original car that has been maintained and kept its unique character in the process. This example is mechanically superb, the engine having been rebuilt some 10,000 kms ago.  The car is fitted with Empi accessories wherever you look, adding to its charm. A very rare steering wheel completes the picture. The car reflects its 60 year old patina very gracefully. This is a jump in and set off to  the beach example. If you check the Autotrader ads there are numerous examples with several at the R350,000 and upwards level. The trick to a good Beetle is to drive as many as you can  for they differ dramatically in feel, depending on who and how they have been maintained. This is a good one.

The new generation BMW TwinPower Turbo, 2 litre and 4-cylinder petrol engine is notable for its agile power delivery and outstanding responsiveness, even at low engine speeds. This results in high fuel efficiency and low emissions.\nThe BMW 330is Edition is equipped with an M Sport package and 20” M Performance wheels. The M Aerodynamic kit includes an M Performance front splitter, M Performance side skirts in body colour, M Performance boot spoiler and an M Performance exhaust for added sportiness.\nThe M Sport brakes have four-piston fixed callipers at the front and single-piston floating callipers at the rear, in blue with the M designation and features large brake discs to ensure outstanding stopping power.\nThe 10 millimetre lowered Adaptive M suspension can be electronically adjusted to suit all driving and road conditions. The driver can also adjust the suspension characteristics via the Driving Experience Control to enable their preferred driving style – from comfortable to athletic.\nThe variable sport steering creates a direct and agile steering response, improving the handling when driving more dynamically. This is complemented by the 8 -Speed Steptronic Sport transmission that offers sporty gear changes. Whether automatic or manual using gearshift paddles or the gear lever, the gear shifts are configured optimally.\nThe BMW Individual high-gloss Shadow Line (inspired by the BMW 325i Shadow Line introduced in 1985) with extended features also includes a black grille and darkened interior headlights. Each BMW 330is Edition also carries an authentic boot badge unique to the vehicle.\nTo spark nostalgia, the BMW 330is Edition is available in a choice of colours – from classic Glacier Silver, striking Melbourne Red and timeless Alpine White to the sleek Black Sapphire.\nOne-of-a -kind interior\nFrom the unique Edition doorsills on the front passenger and driver side to the interior trim finisher with 330is, the BMW 330is Edition features an exclusively sporty interior. Unique door sills with 330is insignia for the front passenger and driver, as well as leather 'Vernasca' Black with decorative stitching ensure the vehicle stand out.\nM seat belts, an M leather steering wheel, ambient interior lighting, anthracite roof lining, a glass sliding sunroof and a Harman Kardon Surround Sound system complete the package. The BMW 330is comes standard with next generation technology such as BMW Gesture Control, Park Assist and Live Cockpit Professional.\nThe sport seats for the driver and front passenger provide the most ideal lumbar support with their raised side bolsters and adjustable support.
